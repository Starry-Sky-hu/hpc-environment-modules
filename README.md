# ILRI HPC Environment Modules
This repo contains [Environment Modules](http://modules.sourceforge.net) used in [ILRI's research computing](https://hpc.ilri.cgiar.org/) infrastructure.

For a full list of software, including build and usage instructions, see the [list of software](https://hpc.ilri.cgiar.org/list-of-software) on ILRI's HPC wiki.

## Assumptions
These modules load and unload programs installed in the `/export/apps/$SOFTWARE/$SOFTWARE_VERSION` directory.

For example, in our infrastructure, *NCBI BLAST 2.2.30+* is installed in `/export/apps/blast/2.2.30+`.
